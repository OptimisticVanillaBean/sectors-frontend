# Project Setup Guide

This project is a web application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to register, select sectors they are involved in, and submit a form with their selections.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your Git repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.

4. Start the development server:

Make sure that the sectors-backend service is running and is available on port 8080.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server. You should be able to see your application by opening `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL provided in the terminal) in your web browser.
